                <h2>My favourite activity is playing Badminton</h2>
                <p>I love to play <b>Badminton</b> because it <b>Improves muscle -strength</b> and 
                    <b>Improves flexibility</b>. It is better than Gym, While Gym offers you 
                    flexibility on the types of equipment and the muscles you want to concentrate on, 
                    Sports on the other hand <b>tones your entire body</b>. While you have an intense 
                    session at the Gym, you can hit the Badminton courts and relax by playing a game or 
                    two.</p>
